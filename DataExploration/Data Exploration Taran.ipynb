Berkshire has said it ended June with more than $135 billion of equity investments, which Buffett mainly controls and holds for the long term. The conglomerate is sitting on huge gains in big investments such as American Express Co ( AXP.N ), Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ) and Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ), while other bets such as International Business Machines Corp ( IBM.N ) have fared less well. Buffett had said at Berkshire\\u2019s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, on May 6 that he would rather realize losses than take gains if he expected rates to fall.

       " u\"With no viable female presidential contender in sight, all indicators point to essentially a three-man race. Sirleaf\\u2019s 'pseudo-incumbent' vice president, Joseph Boakai, is likely to go head-to-head with opposition candidates George Weah (a soccer player-turned-senator who entered a political coalition with Charles Taylor\\u2019s ex-wife, Sen. Jewel Howard-Taylor) and Charles Brumskine, a lawyer and former president pro tempore of the Liberian Senate. [ This short video shows what Africans think of their elections ] Though unlikely to win, new political aspirants such as former Coca-Cola chief executive Alexander Cummings, former Central Bank governor J. Mills Jones, and serial entrepreneur and former Taylor loyalist Benoni Urey have forced more-established candidates such as Boakai, Brumskine and Weah to enter into meaningful political alliances to court undecided voters. During a presidential debate in August sponsored by a coalition of Liberian civil society activists, the four candidates who turned up were questioned about how they would maintain Liberia\\u2019s precarious peace; reduce poverty; revitalize an economy plagued by recurrent budget deficits; implement the highly politicized Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommendations; mitigate gender-based violence; and eliminate corruption. Although party platforms tended to cohere, purported front-runners like Boakai and Brumskine were seemingly outperformed by newcomer Cummings.

This will be the fast food company's first foray into the ready-to-drink coffee category, and the bottled drinks will join McDonald's already successful line of whole bean, ground and single-serve coffee currently available in restaurants across the US. Moreover, this investment is in line with our view that ready-to-drink coffee will be an outperforming segment of the US beverages market, as the 'on-the-go' trend holds strong appeal among busy millennials (see 'Ready-To-Drink Coffee Set For Rapid Expansion As Coca-Cola Enters Market', September 2016). McDonalds is seeking to diversify its portfolio by investing in its McCafe brand, instead of relying solely on its meals business, allowing it to attract a constant stream of customers throughout the day, rather than during meal periods. In addition, the company is also hoping to add a new clientele to their restaurant chain by appealing to time-starved young adults who are looking for convenience and simplicity in getting their morning or afternoon coffee.

       " u'The Singapore approach is different from other countries however, where tax legislation has been imposed to reduce sugar consumption, putting an increased burden on consumers by raising prices. The Singapore government has instead negotiated with beverage manufacturers directly in order to come to an agreement on cutting down the amount of sugar in sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs). Among the beverage manufacturers that have shown their support are industry leaders Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestle, Pokka, F&N Foods, Malaysia Diary Industries and Yeo Hiap Seng, all of which have committed to a maximum sugar content of 12% for all drinks sold in Singapore by 2020. According to the MOH, the move could reduce sugar consumption by 300,000kg per year. Meeting the requirements outlined by the Singaporean government will be easy and relatively pain-free for soft drinks firms given that most have already started lowering the sugar content of their offerings.

While Coca-Cola may have been the first in recent times to explore food-inspired campaigns in Nigeria, it may actually be Peak Milk that glamorized and made the practice trendy and more sustainable with the launch and successful execution of Pecadomo. In Nigeria, consumers are quite familiar with the idea of enjoying milk with tea, pap, cornflakes, Quaker Oats and other traditional breakfast items.

       " u'The bottled drink from Mexico has become a menu feature from New Orleans to Ann Arbor, and of course in its biggest market, Texas. Now, Topo Chico is part of the Coca-Cola family.

Barragan Morales, chairman of Arca International, said the move will \"further enhance its presence in the U.S., adding tremendous value to the country\\'s product portfolio.\" Most likely, Coke\\'s ownership will transform Topo Chico into a brand that is available in far more places.

       " u\"However, I always try to provide possible conviction buys so if I did still have free capital to deploy, here's where I'd be looking: PepsiCo ( PEP ) It's been a while since I can safely say this, but PepsiCo looks decently near to fair value these days. It's been in a bit of a slump lately (be sure to watch for news and reactions after the company's earnings report on 10/4!) but remains a great choice in the Consumer Staples sector. Unlike Coca-Cola ( KO ), which has focused almost exclusively on beverage diversification as it seeks to streamline its business model, PepsiCo has made successful forays into snack foods with various popular brands that have diversified its revenue stream. While I can hardly call PepsiCo cheap, it's one of those companies that always trades well above fair value, so any opportunity to grab at or near those levels is possibly a shot worth taking.
